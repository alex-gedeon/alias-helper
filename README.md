# alias-helper

## Terminal based utility intended to streamline the usage of aliases: a fantastic way to optimize productivity

If you hate typing repetitive commands like `cd /mnt/c/....`, `explorer.exe .`, or simply like being able to easily open files through the terminal with annoying to reach executables, then you'll love being able to just create a new alias on the fly, restart the terminal, and simply type the short alias from then on to do your required task.

Current functionality:

- Command line parsing
- Prints a table to display aliases

Future plans:

- Create aliases locally (in ~/.bash_aliases file)
- Remove displayed aliases
- Remove previously added aliases (from ~/.bash_aliases)
- Installation script
